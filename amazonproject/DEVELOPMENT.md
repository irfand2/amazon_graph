#### Week of _23 November, 2020_
Completed interface and implementation of graph class. Tested basic functionality of the class. Had second meeting to brief team on the interface. Completed DFS algorithm on graph. Tested and traced DFS on a graph with 8 nodes. Ran DFS on graph of full dataset and saved path as a text file. Started implementation of dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path. Had third meeting to discuss results of DFS, status of dijkstra's algorithm and goals for week 3.

#### Week of _30 November, 2020_
Completed implementation of dijkstra and pagerank. Fixed bugs in graph class. Had fourth meeting to disscuss the remaining goals. Added comments and increased the readibility of the code.

#### Week of _07 December, 2020_
Created a subset of original dataset to prevent memory problems. Changed the graph implementation to be more memory efficient, removed unneccessary containers and deleted unused functions. All current tests are passed now.
